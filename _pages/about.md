I am Linke Song, a first-year PhD Candidate since 2024 (transfered to PhD track), from Institute of Information Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Beforehand, I completed my bachelor degree in Cyberspace Security in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022, and continued to pursuit my master degree in 2022. 

My research areas mainly revolve around **operating system**, **confidential computing**, and **side channels**. Since 2022, I've remained an avid self-learner of computer courses. I'm quite interested in fields that intersect with my research, such as cryptography, hardware-software co-design, and large language models (LLMs). 

I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Wenhao Wang](https://heartever.github.io/) and [Prof. Wei Song](https://wsong83.github.io/index.html).

I'm confident that I have the capability to quickly meet the minimum requirements of the necessary disciplinary knowledge in order to turn a new idea into reality. I've rebuilt all my basic skills since 2022 by refering to [csdiy.wiki](https://csdiy.wiki). Courses I've taken in my spare time equipped me the base to conduct my research.
