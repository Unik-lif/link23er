I am Linke Song, a first-year PhD Candidate since 2024 (transfered to PhD track), from Institute of Information Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Beforehand, I completed my bachelor degree in Cyberspace Security in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022, and continued to pursuit my master degree in 2022. 

My research areas mainly revolve around **operating system virtualization**, **confidential computing**, and **side channels**. Since 2022, I've remained an avid self-learner of computer courses. I'm quite interested in fields that intersect with my research, such as cryptography, hardware-software co-design, and large language models (LLMs). To equip myself with the fundamental competencies for related research, I take the initiative to self-study relevant courses ahead of time.

During my undergraduate years, I blindly attended classes without thinking about my true interests. Before finding the website [csdiy.wiki](https://csdiy.wiki), I had little enthusiasm for computer science and was just seeking a bachelor diploma. However, the courses on csdiy.wiki reignited my passion for learning. After getting exempted from the postgraduate entrance exam in my senior year, I made the tough call to start over and relearn computer science. It was a hard choice, but it paid off. My professional skills improved remarkably. I'm deeply thankful to the teachers who shared these resources and to my supervisor [Prof. Wenhao Wang](https://heartever.github.io/), who gave me the freedom to explore and learn in my final undergraduate year.

I'm confident that I have the capability to quickly meet the minimum requirements of the necessary disciplinary knowledge in order to turn a new idea into reality.
